#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! I'm a first year PhD student in computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by Prof., [Ge Liu](https://www.mit.edu/~geliu/). Previously, I obtained my Bachelors ans Masters in Mathematics at Yale University, advised by Prof. [Rex Ying](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/) and Prof. [Menglin Yang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=509). I'm mainly insterested in geometric deep learning, such as generative modelling on Riemannian manifolds and non-Euclidean foundation models, with applications in the natural sciences such as protein synthesis. I'm also broadly interested in exploring how to build foundation models for structured datasets, particularly for real-world applications.
